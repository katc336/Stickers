## Description:
As an educator, I was inspired to create this app after seeing my colleagues spending hours creating and updating large spreadsheets to calculate and track student data. I knew there had to be a better way, so I set out to develop a tool that would streamline the tracking process and provide a digital solution that could be accessed and updated on-the-go.

With this app, you can easily input and update student data, and track specific learning objectives over time. It also analyzes trends and helps you identify learning gaps across entire classes, or for individual students.

This app is a free resource for educators, and I hope it helps to simplify and improve the student data tracking process so you can focus on teaching and all the important work educators do. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for future improvements. If you would like to contribute to the app, suggest a feature, or report a bug, please do!
